        <h1>Nadezhda Evstyukhina's Doping Incident</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="story-body">
        <h2>Background and Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Nadezhda Evstyukhina, a Russian weightlifter, became embroiled in a major doping controversy linked to the 2012 London Olympics. She was initially awarded the silver medal in the women’s 75 kg weightlifting category after an impressive performance at the Olympics, finishing behind the gold medalist. However, her success was overshadowed by a doping scandal that emerged after the reanalysis of her doping sample from the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The International Olympic Committee (IOC) began reanalyzing samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympic Games to uncover evidence of doping, particularly in light of increased scrutiny over the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) by Russian athletes. This was part of a wider investigation into systemic doping within the Russian sporting system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evstyukhina's A-sample from the 2012 London Olympics tested positive for stanozolol, an anabolic steroid. This substance is commonly used to increase muscle mass and improve performance. It was considered one of the most widely abused substances among athletes, especially in weightlifting.
        </p>
        <h2>Aftermath of the Positive Test</h2>
        <p>
          Upon the discovery of her positive test, Evstyukhina’s silver medal from the London Games was immediately revoked by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF). The IOC officially stripped her of her medal and placed her on a list of athletes who had violated anti-doping regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evstyukhina was banned from competing in international competitions and faced an extensive suspension. She was one of several Russian athletes caught in the wave of doping violations that plagued the 2012 Olympics and subsequent events.
        </p>
        <h2>Evstyukhina’s Response</h2>
        <p>
          Nadezhda Evstyukhina, like many athletes who are caught in doping cases, denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs. However, she did not dispute the findings of the reanalysis, and the presence of stanozolol in her sample was undeniable.
