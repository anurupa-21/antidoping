            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>
              Lance Armstrong was considered one of the greatest cyclists of all time, especially renowned for his Tour de France wins. He won the prestigious race seven times consecutively from 1999 to 2005, a record that elevated him to global stardom. Armstrong was celebrated not only for his incredible cycling ability but also for his inspiring comeback from testicular cancer, which he had battled and overcome in the late 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Armstrong's rise to prominence made him an icon in the sport, and his victories in the Tour de France were seen as monumental achievements. He also used his fame to launch his Livestrong Foundation, which helped raise awareness about cancer and fund cancer research.
            </p>
            <h2>The Doping Test:</h2>
            <p>
              The doping scandal surrounding Lance Armstrong began to unravel in 2012 when the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) conducted an extensive investigation into Armstrong's career. The investigation, known as the USADA Reasoned Decision, revealed a web of systematic doping within Armstrong's cycling teams, specifically focusing on the use of epo (erythropoietin), blood transfusions, and testosterone.
            </p>
            <p>
              In August 2012, USADA issued a report accusing Armstrong of being the ringleader of a doping program that had spanned over a decade, involving not only Armstrong but also his teammates and staff. They claimed that Armstrong had used a combination of prohibited substances throughout his career to gain an unfair advantage and enhance his performance in key events, including the Tour de France.
            </p>
            <h2>The Consequences:</h2>
            <p>
              As a result of the USADA investigation and its findings, Armstrong was stripped of all seven of his Tour de France titles from 1999 to 2005. He was banned for life from competitive cycling by the International Cycling Union (UCI).
            </p>
            <p>
              Armstrong was also disqualified from all of his results from August 1998 onwards, effectively erasing his entire competitive career in the sport.
            </p>
            <h2>Armstrong’s Response:</h2>
            <p>
              Lance Armstrong initially denied the allegations for years, even though suspicions about his doping had existed for a long time. He vehemently defended his innocence, claiming that he had never used performance-enhancing drugs and attributing his success to hard work, determination, and his physical prowess.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, after the USADA report and the stripping of his titles, Armstrong eventually admitted to doping. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013, Armstrong publicly confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs during all of his Tour de France victories. He admitted to using substances such as epo, testosterone, and undergoing blood transfusions as part of a systematic doping program throughout his career.
            </p>
            <h2>The Aftermath:</h2>
            <p>
              Armstrong’s confession and the resulting fallout had profound consequences on his life:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Public Reputation: Armstrong’s reputation as a champion and cancer survivor was irreparably damaged.</li>
              <li>Sponsorships: Major sponsors like Nike, Anheuser-Busch, and Oakley severed ties with Armstrong.</li>
              <li>Legal and Financial Consequences: Armstrong faced several lawsuits and reached a $5 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2018.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Impact on Cycling:</h2>
            <p>
              Armstrong’s doping scandal sent shockwaves through the world of cycling. His case brought attention to the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in the sport, especially during the era of his dominance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the damage Armstrong's doping revelations caused to the sport, they also served as a catalyst for greater efforts to combat doping in professional cycling.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>
              In 2012, Lance Armstrong was exposed as the leader of a widespread doping program. He was stripped of all his Tour de France titles and banned for life from cycling. Though he denied doping for years, Armstrong eventually confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs in 2013. The scandal had devastating financial and reputational consequences, and Armstrong’s case highlighted the ongoing issue of doping in cycling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the scandal, Armstrong continued his charitable work, though his legacy in the sport remains permanently tarnished.
