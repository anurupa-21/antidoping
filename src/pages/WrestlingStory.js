        <h1>Alireza Karimi Doping Incident (2017)</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="story-body">
        <p>
          Alireza Karimi, an Iranian wrestler, became involved in a significant doping
          controversy in 2017 that led to his suspension and banned status in the sport.
          Karimi, a freestyle wrestler, was considered one of Iran's rising stars in the
          sport and had been competing at the highest levels internationally.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Alireza Karimi had achieved success on the world stage before the doping incident.
          He was highly regarded for his skill and technique in freestyle wrestling, which
          earned him a reputation as one of Iran's promising athletes. However, his career
          took a downturn following the announcement of his failed doping test in 2017.
        </p>

        <h2>The Doping Test</h2>
        <p>
          In 2017, Karimi was competing at the Asian Wrestling Championship in New Delhi,
          India, where he secured a victory in the men’s 74 kg category. Shortly after this
          win, he was subjected to routine anti-doping testing that all athletes in
          international competitions undergo. During this process, his sample tested
          positive for steroids—specifically, an anabolic steroid. This class of drugs is
          used by athletes to increase muscle mass, strength, and recovery, giving
          competitors an unfair advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steroid found in Karimi’s sample was later identified as testosterone or
          substances related to it, which are banned in sports due to their
          performance-enhancing effects.
        </p>

        <h2>The Consequences</h2>
        <p>
          Once the results came in, the United World Wrestling (UWW), the sport’s
          international governing body, took action. They suspended Karimi for one year and
          revoked his victory at the 2017 Asian Wrestling Championship. His suspension
          meant he could not participate in any international competitions for that period,
          effectively damaging his career and prospects of representing his country at major
          events like the World Wrestling Championships or the 2018 Asian Games.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ban also led to the forfeiture of any points or prizes won during the
          competition where the doping violation occurred. This included any ranking points
          in international wrestling tournaments, which are crucial for Olympic
          qualification.
