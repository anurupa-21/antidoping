        <p>
          Floyd Mayweather Jr., one of the greatest boxers of all time, has been involved in a few
          controversies throughout his career, but one of the most notable doping-related incidents
          occurred in 2007. While Mayweather himself has never officially been involved in a major
          doping scandal or banned for using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), his situation
          serves as an example of how doping allegations can impact a boxer’s career and public
          perception.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Floyd Mayweather Jr. is regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history, known for his
          impeccable defensive skills and undefeated record. Over his career, Mayweather amassed
          an impressive number of world championship titles in multiple weight classes, making him
          one of the most successful and wealthy athletes in the sport.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Mayweather’s success in the ring led to significant attention, both positive and
          negative. His career was often marred by allegations of improper behavior, legal issues,
          and controversies related to his lifestyle, but he was never officially caught or
          suspended for doping, unlike some of his counterparts.
